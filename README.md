## Work in progress
Replication Package for the "Towards Actionable Explainability: Designing Execo for User-Driven LLM Interaction" paper

The growing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law demands a structured approach to model selection, balancing explainability, accuracy, and energy consumption. 
This research introduces Execo, an actionable framework to guide ICT professionals in balancing the trade-offs between explainability, accuracy, and energy consumption, ensuring that the selected LLM model aligns with domain-specific accountability, compliance, and sustainability requirements.
